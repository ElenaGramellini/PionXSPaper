\begin{abstract}
We present here the measurement of the negative pion total hadronic cross section on Argon in the 100-1050 MeV kinetic energy range as performed at the LArIAT experiment.   Deploying a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) in a dedicated calibration test beam line at Fermilab, LArIAT (Liquid Argon In A Testbeam) aims to experimentally calibrate this technology in a controlled environment. We use LArIAT's beamline detectors to identify candidate pions and measure their momentum prior to entering the LArTPC. We then apply the ``thin slice method" technique, a new method to measure hadron-argon cross sections possible only due to the combination of the tracking and calorimetry capability of the LArTPC technology. 
%Albeit never on argon, the hadronic cross section of pions has been extensively measured before on lighter and heavier different elements in thin target experiments, leading to solid predictions for measurements on argon. 
Our measurement of the  ($\pi^-$-Ar) total hadronic cross section is in general agreement with the predictions by the Geant4 Bertini Cascade model which are based on data from thin target experiments on heavier and lighter nuclei.
The ($\pi^-$, Ar) total cross-section has never been measured before; the outcome of this measurement will enable to quantify and reduce the systematic associated with the hadronic interaction models in neutrino-argon interactions in current ant future LAr experiments such as the Short Baseline Neutrino and DUNE.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Thin slice method, new method
%\item Importance of LArTPC for neutrino experiments
%\item First time measurement
%\end{itemize}

%The Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) represents one of the
%most advanced experimental technologies for physics at the Intensity
%Frontier due to its full 3D-imaging, excellent particle identification
%and precise calorimetric energy reconstruction. By deploying a LArTPC in
%a dedicated calibration test beam line at Fermilab, LArIAT (Liquid
%Argon In A Testbeam) aims to experimentally calibrate this technology
%in a controlled environment and to provide physics results key to the
%neutrino oscillation physics and proton decay searches of the Short
%Baseline Neutrino (SBND, MicroBooNE, ICARUS) and Long Baseline Neutrino programs (DUNE).

%LArIAT's physics program entails a vast set of topics with a
%particular focus on the study of nuclear effects such as pion and
%kaon characteristic interaction modes. 

% The analyses devised for these measurements use both the core elements of LArIAT: beamline and LArTPC. The first step in each analysis is the development of an event selection based on  beamline and TPC information geared towards the identification of the hadron of interest. We then proceed to match the beamline candidate to a suitable TPC track. Finally,  we apply the ``thin slice method" technique and measure the cross section, correcting for background contamination and detector effects. The thin slice technique is a new method to measure hadron-argon cross sections possible only due to the combination of the tracking and calorimetry capability of the LArTPC technology. 
%Albeit never on argon, the hadronic cross section of pions has been extensively measured before on lighter and heavier different elements in thin target experiments, leading to solid predictions for measurements on argon. Through the use of a different technique, our measurement of the  ($\pi^-$-Ar) total hadronic cross section is in general agreement with the predictions by the Geant4 Bertini Cascade model which are based on data from thin target experiments. On the contrary, cross section measurements for kaons are extremely scarce, thus more difficult to model. Our measurement of the  ($K^+$-Ar) total hadronic cross section is mostly in tension with the Geant4 prediction over the explored range of energies and provides new experimental data to properly compare existing interaction models.

%This thesis also reports two  ancillary  detector physics measurements necessary for the cross section analyses: the measurements of the LArIAT electric field and calorimetry constants. We developed a technique to measure the LArIAT electric field using cathode-anode piercing tracks with cosmic data. We applied a new technique for the measurement of the calorimetry calibration constants based on the particles' momentum measurement.


%The ($\pi^-$-Ar) and the ($K^+$-Ar) total hadronic cross measurements are the first physics results of the LArIAT experiment and will be the basis for the future LArIAT measurements of pion and kaon cross sections in the exclusive channels.

%\section{\label{sec:level1}First-level heading}
% sections are not used for PRL papers

This sample document demonstrates proper use of REV\TeX~4 (and
\LaTeXe) in mansucripts prepared for submission to APS
journals. Further information can be found in the REV\TeX~4
documentation included in the distribution or available at
\url{http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/}.

When commands are referred to in this example file, they are always
shown with their required arguments, using normal \TeX{} format. In
this format, \verb+#1+, \verb+#2+, etc. stand for required
author-supplied arguments to commands. For example, in
\verb+\section{#1}+ the \verb+#1+ stands for the title text of the
author's section heading, and in \verb+\title{#1}+ the \verb+#1+
stands for the title text of the paper.

Line breaks in section headings at all levels can be introduced using
\textbackslash\textbackslash. A blank input line tells \TeX\ that the
paragraph has ended. Note that top-level section headings are
automatically uppercased. If a specific letter or word should appear in
lowercase instead, you must escape it using \verb+\lowercase{#1}+ as
in the word ``via'' above.

%\subsection{\label{sec:level2}Second-level heading: Formatting}
% subsections are not used for PRL papers

This file may be formatted in both the \texttt{preprint} and
\texttt{twocolumn} styles. \texttt{twocolumn} format may be used to
mimic final journal output. Either format may be used for submission
purposes; however, for peer review and production, APS will format the
article using the \texttt{preprint} class option. Hence, it is
essential that authors check that their manuscripts format acceptably
under \texttt{preprint}. Manuscripts submitted to APS that do not
format correctly under the \texttt{preprint} option may be delayed in
both the editorial and production processes.

The \texttt{widetext} environment will make the text the width of the
full page.  The width-changing commands only take effect in \texttt{twocolumn}
formatting. It has no effect if \texttt{preprint} formatting is chosen
instead.

To cite bibliography entries, use the \verb+\cite{#1}+ command. Most
journal styles will display the corresponding number(s) in square
brackets: \cite{d0det}. To avoid the square brackets, use
\verb+\onlinecite{#1}+: Refs.~\onlinecite{d0det} and
\onlinecite{geant,pythia}. REV\TeX\ ``collapses'' lists of
consecutive reference numbers where possible. We now cite everyone
together \cite{geant, pythia, cteq}, and once again
(Refs.~\onlinecite{geant, pythia, cteq}). Note that the references
were also sorted into the correct numerical order as well.

Footnotes are produced using the \verb+\footnote{#1}+ command. Most
APS journal styles put footnotes into the bibliography. REV\TeX~4 does
this as well, but instead of interleaving the footnotes with the
references, they are listed at the end of the references. Because the correct
numbering of the footnotes must occur after the numbering of the
references, an extra pass of \LaTeX\ is required in order to get the
numbering correct.


Inline math may be typeset using the \verb+$+ delimiters. Bold math
symbols may be achieved using the \verb+bm+ package and the
\verb+\bm{#1}+ command it supplies. For instance, a bold $\alpha$ can
be typeset as \verb+$\bm{\alpha}$+ giving $\bm{\alpha}$. Fraktur and
Blackboard (or open face or double struck) characters should be
typeset using the \verb+\mathfrak{#1}+ and \verb+\mathbb{#1}+ commands
respectively. Both are supplied by the \texttt{amssymb} package. For
example, \verb+$\mathbb{R}$+ gives $\mathbb{R}$ and
\verb+$\mathfrak{G}$+ gives $\mathfrak{G}$

In \LaTeX\ there are many different ways to display equations, and a
few preferred ways are noted below. Displayed math will center by
default. Use the class option \verb+fleqn+ to flush equations left.

Below we have numbered single-line equations; this is the most common
type of equation in \textit{Physical Review}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi_+(p)\alt{\bf [}2|{\bf p}|(|{\bf p}|+p_z){\bf ]}^{-1/2}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
|{\bf p}|+p_z\\
px+ip_y
\end{array}\right)\;,
\\
\left\{%
 \openone234567890abc123\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
\right\}%
\label{eq:one}.
\end{eqnarray}
Note the open one in Eq.~(\ref{eq:one}).

Not all numbered equations will fit within a narrow column this
way. The equation number will move down automatically if it cannot fit
on the same line with a one-line equation:
\begin{equation}
\left\{
 ab12345678abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
\right\}.
\end{equation}

When the \verb+\label{#1}+ command is used [cf. input for
Eq.~(\ref{eq:one})], the equation can be referred to in text without
knowing the equation number that \TeX\ will assign to it. Just
use \verb+\ref{#1}+, where \verb+#1+ is the same name that used in
the \verb+\label{#1}+ command.

Unnumbered single-line equations can be typeset
using the \verb+\[+, \verb+\]+ format:
\[g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \]


Figures may be inserted by using either the \texttt{graphics} or
\texttt{graphicx} packages. These packages both define the
\verb+\includegraphics{#1}+ command, but they differ in how optional
arguments for specifying the orientation, scaling, and translation of the
figure. Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart} shows a figure that is small enough to
fit in a single column. It is embedded using the \texttt{figure}
environment which provides both the caption and the imports the figure
file.

\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fig_1.ps}
\caption{\label{fig:epsart} A figure caption. The figure captions are
automatically numbered.}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:wide} is a figure that is too wide for a single column,
so instead the \texttt{figure*} environment has been used.
\begin{figure*}
%\includegraphics{fig_2.ps}% Here is how to import EPS art
\caption{\label{fig:wide}Use the figure* environment to get a wide
figure that spans the page in \texttt{twocolumn} formatting.}
\end{figure*}


The heart of any table is the \texttt{tabular} environment which gives
the rows of the tables. Each row consists of column entries separated
by \verb+&+'s and terminates with \textbackslash\textbackslash. The
required argument for the \texttt{tabular} environment
specifies how data are displayed in the columns. For instance, entries
may be centered, left-justified, right-justified, aligned on a decimal
point. Extra column-spacing may be be specified as well, although
REV\TeX~4 sets this spacing so that the columns fill the width of the
table. Horizontal rules are typeset using the \verb+\hline+
command. The doubled (or Scotch) rules that appear at the top and
bottom of a table can be achieved enclosing the \texttt{tabular}
environment within a \texttt{ruledtabular} environment. Rows whose
columns span multiple columns can be typeset using the
\verb+\multicolumn{#1}{#2}{#3}+ command (for example, see the first
row of Table~\ref{tab:table3}).

Tables~\ref{tab:table1}-\ref{tab:table4} show various effects. Tables
that fit in a narrow column are contained in a \texttt{table}
environment. Table~\ref{tab:table3} is a wide table set with the
\texttt{table*} environment. Long tables may need to break across
pages. The most straightforward way to accomplish this is to specify
the \verb+[H]+ float placement on the \texttt{table} or
\texttt{table*} environment. However, the standard \LaTeXe\ package
\texttt{longtable} will give more control over how tables break and
will allow headers and footers to be specified for each page of the
table. A simple example of the use of \texttt{longtable} can be found
in the file \texttt{summary.tex} that is included with the REV\TeX~4
distribution.

There are two methods for setting footnotes within a table (these
footnotes will be displayed directly below the table rather than at
the bottom of the page or in the bibliography). The easiest
and preferred method is just to use the \verb+\footnote{#1}+
command. This will automatically enumerate the footnotes with
lowercase roman letters. However, it is sometimes necessary to have
multiple entries in the table share the same footnote. In this case,
there is no choice but to manually create the footnotes using
\verb+\footnotemark[#1]+ and \verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+.
\texttt{\#1} is a numeric value. Each time the same value for
\texttt{\#1} is used, the same mark is produced in the table. The
\verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+ commands are placed after the \texttt{tabular}
environment. Examine the \LaTeX\ source and output for
Tables~\ref{tab:table1} and \ref{tab:table2} for examples.

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:table1}This is a narrow table which fits into a
narrow column when using \texttt{twocolumn} formatting. Note that
REV\TeX~4 adjusts the intercolumn spacing so that the table fills the
entire width of the column. Table captions are numbered
automatically. This table illustrates left-aligned, centered, and
right-aligned columns.  }
